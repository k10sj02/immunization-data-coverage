## Analysis of Penta 1 Coverage by Region

### Introduction
The dataset provided consists of the Penta 1 vaccine coverage across various regions. This analysis aims to evaluate the coverage levels, identify regions with the highest and lowest coverage, and examine the confidence intervals to understand the precision of the estimates.

### Summary of Findings

1. **Overall Coverage**: The Penta 1 coverage varies significantly across the regions, with the highest coverage observed in Njombe and the lowest in Rukwa.

2. **Highest Coverage**: Njombe has the highest coverage at 9554.3, with a narrow confidence interval (9550.8 - 9557.9), indicating a high level of precision.

3. **Lowest Coverage**: Rukwa has the lowest coverage at 5393.5, with a confidence interval of 5386.3 - 5400.7, also showing good precision.

4. **Top 5 Regions by Coverage**:
   - Njombe: 9554.3 (CI: 9550.8 - 9557.9)
   - Morogoro: 8673.1 (CI: 8667.7 - 8678.5)
